	Nur-Sultan, known as Astana before March 2019, is the capital city of Kazakhstan. It is located in the north-central part of the country, along the Ishim River, at the junction of the Trans-Kazakhstan and South Siberian railways. Founded in 1824 as a Russian military outpost, Nur-Sultan became an administrative centre in 1868. Its population had reached 33,000 when it was made an oblast (province) in 1939.

<p style ="color:black"> 
	Located in the centre of Kazakhstan, the territory of Nur-Sultan exceeds 722 square kilometres with a population of more than one million. The city consists of three districts – former capital Almaty, Saryaka and Yessil. Situated in the dry steppe zone, which is a sub-zone of dry grass steppes, Nur-Sultan’s climate is sharply continental with cold and long winters and hot, moderately arid summers. Its convenient location in the centre of the Eurasian continent makes Nur-Sultan an economically advantageous transport, communication and logistics centre, described as a “transit bridge” between Europe and Asia.

	Nur-Sultan boasts futuristic architecture with a skyline that rivals Dubai’s. The city is also home to educational and cultural institutions, including several universities, an opera, a symphony orchestra, museums and shopping malls. Nur-Sultan is distinctly modern, thanks to President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s efforts to make it a culturally advanced city in Central Asia. The city has been spending billions of dollars hiring international architects, making Nur-Sultan an interesting site with a unique mix of futuristic architecture and Kazakh flair. It is home to many impressive government buildings, such as the Presidential Palace, Parliament House and Supreme Court.

Noteworthy tourist spots include the Bayterek, a 97-metre high monument and observation tower completed in 1997. It is meant to embody a Kazakh folk tale about a mythical tree of life and a magic bird of happiness. The height of the tower commemorates the year that Nur-Sultan became the nation’s capital in 1997.

Unveiled in 2006, the Khan Shatyr is a giant, glowing tent built in the neo-futurist style. Standing at 150 metres, the tent has an enormous 140,000 square metre base. Inside, it houses a park large enough to fit 10 football stadiums. It also has numerous shopping and entertainment venues, a boating river and a mini golf course. Designed by British architect Norman Foster, it is the highest tent structure in the world. During the day, it is entirely flooded with sunlight, while at night, the Khan Shatyr is a site to behold, as it is brilliantly lit up by changing colours.
